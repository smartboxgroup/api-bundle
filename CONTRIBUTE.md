# How to contribute

This is still in a non-stable version.
Feel free to have a look around and experiment with the code.

You are welcome to submit a pull request but be sure to do the following:

  - Provide a meaningful description of the changes and a rationale for them
  - Add test cases for the new code (and be sure all the tests are passing ðŸ˜Ž)
  - Comply with the php-cs standards for Symfony (soon to be added in the test suite)

Thanks!
